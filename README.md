# Object Detector
A Python script that does object detection with OpenCV.

The goal of this project is to use a pre-trained network capable of detecting 90 objects from the COCO dataset (including cars, dogs, handbags, laptops, among many others). The code requires a camera to capture the video. Laptop webcams can be used for this purpose.

This method allows to have a balance between speed and accuracy, as it can be ran in real-time with a good amount of accuracy.
